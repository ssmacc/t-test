# The Stroop Effect

The Stroop task involves presenting participants with a list of color names (Red, Blue, Green, Purple), with each words displayed in color ink. The participants must say aloud the color of ink which the color names are written. This project identifies the dependent and independent variables, states the hypothesis and null hypothesis and performs a dependent T-test.
